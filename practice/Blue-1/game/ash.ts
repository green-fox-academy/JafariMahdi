/*
Every pokemon has a name and a type. Certain types are effective against others, e.g. water is effective against fire.

You have a Pokemon class with a method called isEffectiveAgainst().

Ash has a few pokemon. Help Ash decide which Pokemon to use against the wild one.

You can use the already created pokemon files. */
