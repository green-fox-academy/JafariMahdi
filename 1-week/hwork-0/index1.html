                A drawing of a usual modern desktop computer.
                A computer is a machine (mostly electronic) that is able 
                to accept data as input, process that data using predefined
                 algorithms and data structures, and perform tasks as output - 
                including the transformation of raw data into information, then knowledge, 
                and finally insight about the data's domain. 
                Output also takes the form of the performance of physical tasks,
                as well as data storage, data transformation, and data retrieval. 
                Computers can also form networks with other computers 
                for the purposes of data interchange and leveraging a 
                distributed programming model for parallel processing.</h3>
